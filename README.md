fun little project
Planned Features:
Simulate the score outcomes of a specific player/lineup (free, pay to import mass lineups)
Display correlation coefficients between two players in the same game (free prob)
Allow users to tweak player projections with a multiplier based on who they like-free (maybe full on importing new projections in the future, paid)
Generate Ownership Projections (for now estimated solely by percentage of simulations a player is in optimal lineup, possibly allow user to modify) free/paid
Generate User Lineups with target stack frequencies (paid, free to a certain number of lineups?)
Generate a possible lineup pool of opposing lineups based on ownership projections and target stack frequencies (free prob)
Define contest prize structures and simulate the performance (expected value, growth) of a lineup in said contest (certain number of contests free)
Recommend which contests to enter to maximize expected growth or value (paid)
Player Fade tool- identify players who benefit the most from a specific player underperforming in terms of lineup optimality (free)b
